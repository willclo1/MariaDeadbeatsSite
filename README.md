## **Update Database (Python - Long Way)**

### **Step-by-Step Instructions**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/willclo1/MariaDeadbeats.git
   ```
2. Log into your MariaDB server using the shell:
   ```bash
   mysql -u your_username -p
   ```
3. Create a new empty database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE MariaDeadbeats;
   ```
4. Switch to the `MariaDeadbeats` database:
   ```sql
   USE MariaDeadbeats;
   ```
5. Run the `baseball.sql` file to initialize the database:
   - **macOS/Linux**:
     ```sql
     source /path/to/baseball.sql;
     ```
   - **Windows**:
     ```sql
     source C:\\path\\to\\baseball.sql;
     ```
6. Set up a virtual environment and install requirements in the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd MariaDeadbeats
   python -m venv project_env
   source project_env/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   project_env\Scripts\activate    # Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
7. Configure the `cfg.py` file with the correct connection information for your database.
8. Navigate to the project root and run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python -m tableActions.updateDB
   ```
9. Your database is updated!
